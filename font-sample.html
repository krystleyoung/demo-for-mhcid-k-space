    <p class="title">Look up at the stars</p>
    <p class="body">I resonate the most with the dreamers who look up - to space, to the stars. They're the true romantics. Their head is in the clouds, in space, amongst the stars while their feet remain on the ground.

    <p class="quote">most importantly <b>love</b><br>
      like it's the only thing you know how<br>
      at the end of the day<br>
      this means nothing<br>
      this page<br>
      where you're sitting<br>
      your degree<br>
      your job<br>
      the money<br>
      nothing even matters<br>
      except love and human connection<br>
      who you loved<br>
      and how deeply you loved them<br>
      how you touched the people around you<br>
      and how much you gave them<br>
